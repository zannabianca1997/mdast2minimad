# `mdast2minimad`
This crate has the objective to export the largest possible subset of [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) from the crate [markdown](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs) to the ast exposed by the crate [minimad](https://docs.rs/minimad/latest/minimad/index.html). 

The main use of this crate is in [dices](https://github.com/zannabianca1997/dices), where the ast is edited to render the code example before using [termimand](https://github.com/Canop/termimad) to print them.
